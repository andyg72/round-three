# Challenge #3: Livin' la Vida Yoda

Github has an open API called the Zen API. Its endpoint is here:

https://api.github.com/zen

Your task is to write a method to "Yodafy" the content returned by the Zen API. You can use either Ruby or Javascript, but you must write tests!

Note: Default API limit is 60 requests per hour. If you need to read more, look up how to make authenticated requests!

To Yodafy means:

1. Arrange words in order random, you must.
2. Begin with capital letters, sentences must.
3. End with punctuation, sentences must!

BONUS:

1. Content of [Makers Academy website](http://www.makersacademy.com), yodafy, you must! API, there is not. Internet, your friend, is.

### Tips

Try to take a test-driven approach - having a spec file is necessary to pass the challenge.

Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of well-written tests, clean + readable code, and adherence to SOLID principles.

When your 15 minutes is up, push your solution to Github and Hipchat the repo link to the Codejam room.
